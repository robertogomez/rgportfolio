					I have always believed that it's important 
					to acquire practical, real-life experience outside of 
					the classroom. To that end I was selected to 
					participate in the 
					<a href="//alliance.sdccmesa.com/archives/2692"> 2012 
					NSF/MESA Summer Team Internship Program</a>. As a research 
					assistant for the SDSU Department of Electrical and 
					Computer Engineering, I developed a semi-autonomous, 
					mobile robot with object avoidance capabilities. Based on 
					the popular 
					<a href="//irobot.com/us/robots/Educators/Create.aspx">
					iRobot Create®</a> platform, it used two ultrasonic 
					sensors for object detection. For interfacing between the 
					platform and sensors, I programmed an 
					<a href="//arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMega">
					Arduino Mega</a> microcontroller. It was responsible for 
					interpreting the sensor data, determining if obstructions 
					were in the robot's path, and issuing movement commands.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					While it was a simple project as far as robotics go, it 
					involved many disciplines, such as 
					electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. First, 
					I determined how to connect all the components so that 
					they would all function as a single system. For example, 
					I created a simple circuit on a breadboard that delivered 
					power from the iRobot® to the sensors and microcontroller. 
					Then I programmed the Arduino (which essentially uses 
					C/C++ language) to analyze the pulse width output signals 
					from the two sensors. If an object was detected within 
					ten inches, the microcontroller would send a sequence of 
					bytes to the platform through serial communication to 
					initiate a simple avoidance maneuver that consisted of 
					stopping, rotating a number of degrees, and continuing
					forward. Lastly, I designed a few parts in 
					<a href="//solidworks.com/sw/products/3d-cad/solidworks-3d-cad.htm">
					SolidWorks</a> to provide mounting surfaces for the 
					components. The parts were formed from Plexiglas using a 
					CNC machine in the SDSU engineering machine shop.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					Looking back, this research has given me a great 
					sense of accomplishment. It has definitely increased 
					my knowledge and appreciation for robotics and embedded 
					systems. For more information view the research poster 
					my partner and I created (he worked on a website for the 
					Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol). If you would like to 
					know some of the technical details of the robot I can
					send you my report for the project.

					As it so happens I was also involved in MESA's first
					<a href="//alliance.sdccmesa.com/archives/262"> 
					Summer Team Internship</a> event in 2008. I am proud to 
					have been a part of this successful program, now in its 
					fifth year, on two separate occasions. That year, when I 
					was studying mechanical engineering at SDSU, I worked 
					for <a href="//ga-esi.com/">General Atomics 
					Electronic Systems, Inc.</a> (GA-ESI) as a quality 
					assurance (QA) intern. The QA work I did was for 
					sophisticated aircraft launching and arresting systems 
					called <a href="//ga.com/emals">EMALS</a> and 
					<a href="//ga.com/advanced-arresting-gear"
					>AAG</a>. What I primarily did was document the 
					change control process of parts and materials that did not 
					meet their specifications. Some of my responsibilities 
					included gathering non-conformance reports from inspectors,
					writing supplier's disposition request (SDR) forms to 
					record deficient items, and maintaining a spreadsheet to 
					log and track said SDR's. As my first internship 
					experience, I really enjoyed contributing to such an 
					important and fast-paced project.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					In the summer of 2009 I returned to work for GA-ESI again 
					as a QA intern. I was given much more of a hands-on 
					position as I assisted inspecting parts and materials 
					to ensure they met the drawings and specifications required
					by engineers. In this position I learned first hand the 
					importance of quality assurance. Although my work in these 
					internships did not involve software development, I 
					believe that they have given me the experience of 
					working in a large, project-based company that is valuable 
					in any organization.
