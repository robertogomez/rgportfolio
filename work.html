                        <p>
                            I have always believed that it's important
                            to acquire practical, real-life experience outside of
                            the classroom. To that end I was selected to
                            participate in the
                            <a href="//alliance.sdccmesa.com/archives/2692"> 2012
                            NSF/MESA Summer Team Internship Program</a>. As a research
                            assistant for the SDSU Department of Electrical and
                            Computer Engineering, I developed a semi-autonomous,
                            mobile robot with object avoidance capabilities. Based on
                            the popular
                            <a href="//irobot.com/us/robots/Educators/Create.aspx">
                            iRobot Create®</a> platform, it used two ultrasonic
                            sensors for object detection. For interfacing between the
                            platform and sensors, I programmed an
                            <a href="//arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMega">
                            Arduino Mega</a> microcontroller. It was responsible for
                            interpreting the sensor data, determining if obstructions
                            were in the robot's path, and issuing movement commands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it was a simple project as far as robotics go, it
                            involved many disciplines, such as
                            electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. First,
                            I determined how to connect all the components so that
                            they would all function as a single system. For example,
                            I created a simple circuit on a breadboard that delivered
                            power from the iRobot® to the sensors and microcontroller.
                            Then I programmed the Arduino (which essentially uses
                            C/C++ language) to analyze the pulse width output signals
                            from the two sensors. If an object was detected within
                            ten inches, the microcontroller would send a sequence of
                            bytes to the platform through serial communication to
                            initiate a simple avoidance maneuver that consisted of
                            stopping, rotating a number of degrees, and continuing
                            forward. Lastly, I designed a few parts in
                            <a href="//solidworks.com/sw/products/3d-cad/solidworks-3d-cad.html">
                            SolidWorks</a> to provide mounting surfaces for the
                            components. The parts were formed from Plexiglas using a
                            CNC machine in the SDSU engineering machine shop.

                            Looking back, this research has given me a great
                            sense of accomplishment. It has definitely increased
                            my knowledge and appreciation for robotics and embedded
                            systems. For more information view the research poster
                            my partner and I created (he worked on a website for the
                            Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol). If you would like to
                            know some of the technical details of the robot I can
                            send you my report for the project.

                        <p>
                            As it so happens I was also involved in MESA's first
                            <a href="//alliance.sdccmesa.com/archives/262">
                            Summer Team Internship</a> event in 2008. I am proud to
                            have been a part of this successful program, now in its
                            fifth year, on two separate occasions. That year, when I
                            was studying mechanical engineering at SDSU, I worked
                            for <a href="//ga-esi.com/">General Atomics Electronic
                            Systems, Inc.</a> (GA-ESI) as a quality assurance (QA)
                            intern. The QA work I did was for sophisticated aircraft
                            launching and arresting systems called
                            <a href="//ga.com/emals">EMALS</a> and
                            <a href="//ga.com/advanced-arresting-gear">AAG</a>.
                            What I primarily did was document the change control
                            process of parts and materials that did not meet their
                            specifications. Some of my responsibilities included
                            gathering non-conformance reports from inspectors,
                            writing supplier's disposition request (SDR) forms to
                            record deficient items, and maintaining a spreadsheet to
                            log and track said SDR's. As my first internship
                            experience, I really enjoyed contributing to such an
                            important and fast-paced project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the summer of 2009 I returned to work for GA-ESI again
                            as a QA intern. I was given much more of a hands-on
                            position as I assisted inspecting parts and materials
                            to ensure they met the drawings and specifications required
                            by engineers. In this position I learned first hand the
                            importance of quality assurance. Although my work in these
                            internships did not involve software development, I
                            believe that they have given me the experience of
                            working in a large, project-based company that is valuable
                            in any organization.
