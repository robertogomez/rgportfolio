Issues

w3 html validator says having carrage return in middle of some tags like img
src and coords is bad, results in long lines check if issue with scite
firefox still selects unselectable classed elements thus may need to apply
separate style for tab selection coloring or add to header-footer-links
same text selection is applied to fancybox captions
Link area extends to the psuedo elements on background tabs
Right parenthesis ) is bolder than the rest of the chars, probably local
issue with font Lucida Grande
ask question of fancybox minwidth on stackoverflow, maybe first ask creator
for compatibility issues with ie see
google conditionally apply css
