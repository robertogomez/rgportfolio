Issues

firefox still selects unselectable classed elements thus may need to apply
separate style for tab selection coloring or add to header-footer-links
look into cross browser difference in colors
same text selection is applied to fancybox captions
Link area extends to the psuedo elements on background tabs
Right parenthesis ) is bolder than the rest of the chars, probably local
issue with font Lucida Grande
ask question of fancybox minwidth on stackoverflow, maybe first ask creator
for compatibility issues with ie see
google conditionally apply css
http://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/
on zoom out of work page, at least at 25% and 67%, location of tab menu is 
lower than the header and the psuedo elements can be seen

incompatibilities

common.css
* Tab menu may not be fully supported in older versions of IE.
 * User selection prevention uses non-standard browser properties.
 * For older IE versions, may need to use unselectable attribute
 * default to simpler nav menu for IE.
 * Current use of :not in selector of text selection is not supported in <IE8
