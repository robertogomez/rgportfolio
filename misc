May have found bug/limitation in fancybox: if minWidth/minHeight
is specified for one image in an image set, it only works if you
first click on the image. additionally you can't select next/prev
images cause arrows are missing. can view other images if you 
select them first, but when you select the image you applied 
minWidth/minHeight using next/prev arrows, the property is not
set and it is resized to dimension below the prop
