 *	Description:	CSS external stylesheet for work page
 *					work.html
 *
 *	Revision:		A
 *					Fixed link areas of tabs.
 *					Renamed class which denotes current page
 *					to selected in order to avoid confusion with
 *					psuedo-class active (used in link selection).
 *					Moved common stylesheet elements to common.css.
