/*
 * Notes
 *
 * Maybe increase height of footer to allow scrolling a bit below it
 * so it doesn't look so short at bottom of page.
 * Properties that are not common and need to be in each css:
 * heights of wrap div, tops of email and linkedin
 * Need height property for wrap div since it is specific to each page
 * May want think borders around images
 * May want to use transparent titles for comments directly 
 * on images like in older home page versions.
