/*
 * Update
 *
 * Before site launch remember to update these:
 * Mount image need 1024x768 and new 800x600
 */

/*
 * Notes
 *
 * Maybe make margins same as home page just for uniformity
 * Remember to do a spell check on qa text
 * To make robot text fit, can also decrease margins, decrease robot
 * image sizes, increase height of page, and change size of images 
 * Can try making the robot main picture position in line with the text
 * so that the text can wrap around underneath it. Can still have small
 * images absolute positioned, and give the main image a large bottom-
 * margin so that text wraps below small images.
 * Look into increasing size between text lines like most websites
 * consider posting robot report on site, else may available on request
 * ask question of fancybox minwidth on stackoverflow, maybe first 
 * ask creator
 * The hover effect for images is also affecting them when they're 
 * viewed in fancybox, maybe apply hover only to link or image 
 * individually, else disable hover effect
 * Add specifics, quantify, the word content of the works so its more 
 * specific, less general
 * add captions below robot text like in magazine from clockwise etc
 * or make use of captions in lightbox
 * Maybe increase height of footer to allow scrolling a bit below it
 * so it doesn't look so short at bottom of page.
 * maybe reduce unused space between both containers
