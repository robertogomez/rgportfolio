NAME
	rgportfolio - the portfolio website of Roberto Gomez, Jr.

DESCRIPTION
	This project is an online portfolio, hosted at www.robertogomezjr.com, that 
	serves to demonstrate some of my work and interests. It aims to present 
	these in a minimal, accessible fashion. The importance of presentation 
	and features is placed above the need for compatibility. However, efforts 
	will be made to provide for access from older browsers. In its current 
	state, the portfolio is a simple fixed width layout with three web pages. 
	Further goals include creating a projects page and adding a fluid layout.
